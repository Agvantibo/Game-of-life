# Dmitriy's game of life - manual
### Part 1 - Getting ready
For this game to work you should install these packages:
    gearbox
    playsound
    colorama
Gearbox is a custom offline-only package designed to simplify the main code and collect all the tools in one place. If you haven't got it - reinstall this project...
Playsound and colorama, on the other hand, are listed in PyPi and are PIP-installable through their corresponding commands.
Also you should use a Python 3 interpreter to run this, Python 2 won't do the trick...
### Part 2 - Usage
The game is started by executing main.py. It could be done with a Python executable, through CMD or using an IDE. For Best results use an IDE or Python.exe
Once started it will produce accurate instructions on what to do.
Happy using!
